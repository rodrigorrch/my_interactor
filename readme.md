# MyInteractor

This project will help you apply Ruby concepts by creating a basic version of the popular interactor gem.

## Tools and Concepts We'll Use

- **Argument Forwarding Operator**: Introduced in Ruby 2.7, it forwards arguments from one method to another.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes and raising exceptions.
- **OpenStruct**: Flexible object that can have its attributes added at runtime.
- **self.included Hook Method**: Adds behavior to a module or class when it is included in another module or class.
- **require_relative**: Loads files relative to the file containing the call.
- **End-less Methods**: A shorthand syntax for method definitions introduced in Ruby 3.0.

Note: This mini-project requires at least Ruby 3.


## Running the Script
